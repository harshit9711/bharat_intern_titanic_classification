🚢 Titanic Classification Internship Project 🚢

Excited to share my experience as an intern at Bharat Intern, where I had the incredible opportunity to work on the Titanic Classification project. 🌟

🔍 Project Overview:
In collaboration with a dynamic team, I contributed to building a system that predicts the likelihood of a person's survival in the event of the Titanic sinking. Our goal was to analyze various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more to determine the key drivers of survival on that historic voyage.
